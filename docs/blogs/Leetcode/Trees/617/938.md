This problem involves traversing a binary tree, checking if the value of the nodes are within a given range and if so add it to the total sum.

I will try to tackle this problem with a recursive solution, each time returning either the value if it is within the range or 0 if not.
**My Solution**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        int sum = 0;
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) sum += root.val;
        if (root.left != null) sum += rangeSumBST(root.left,  low, high);
        if (root.right != null) sum += rangeSumBST(root.right,  low, high);
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The above solution uses recursion to calculate the total sum. A sum variable is initialised to 0, if the value of the current node is within the given range we add this value to the sum. We then check if the left and right nodes are null, if not we run the method on them and add whatever they return to the sum. Finally the sum is returned.
