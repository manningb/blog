This problem asks you to return true if the value of every node in the tree is the same.

I plan on implementing a recursive solution which initially stores the value of the current node and passes it to both the left and right nodes.

If it finds one that isn't equal it will return false.

**My Solution**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root) {
        int val = root.val;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return true;
        boolean left = true;
        boolean right = true;
        if (root.left != null) {
            left = isUnivalTree(root.left, val);
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            right = isUnivalTree(root.right, val);
        }
        return left && right;
    }

        public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root, int val) {
            if (root.val != val) return false;
            if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return root.val == val;
            boolean left = true;
            boolean right = true;
            if (root.left != null) {
                left =  isUnivalTree(root.left, val);
            }
            if (root.right != null) {
                right = isUnivalTree(root.right, val);
            }
            return left && right;
    }
}
```

I was having difficulties trying to figure out how to implement proper logic for the second method, which takes the value of the root node as input. After a long while fiddling around with the code, I came to the decision that it would be best to try to implement the logic from the original method rather than reinvent the wheel - and surpise, surpise.. this worked! I initially set out thinking this problem would be much simpler than it was.
