The task of this problem is to essentially flip a binary tree vertically, so that all left nodes are now right nodes and vice versa - this is known as inverting a binary tree.

My approach here will be to swap any left nodes with any right nodes, while keeping track of the root node.

**My Solution**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null || (root.left == null && root.right == null)) return root;
        else {
            invertTree(root, root);
        }
        return root;
    }

    public void invertTree(TreeNode root, TreeNode head) {
        try {
            TreeNode tempVal = root.left;
            root.left = root.right;
            root.right = tempVal;
            invertTree(root.left, head);
            invertTree(root.right, head);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            return;
        }

    }
}
```

I had a few difficulties with this problem. One of the main ones that I had was that I had incorrectly called the invertTree method with root.left twice, rather than calling with both root.left and root.right once each. This meant that the right tree was not being swapped and the left tree appeared as if it wasn't being swapped but in fact was being swapped twice (so back to its initial position).

After solving this issue, I had a problem where I could not check if the root.left or root.right were null without getting a null pointer exception. I handled this issue by surrounding the code in a try catch block and return when a null pointer exception occurred.

Upon looking at other solutions online, I can see that there is a much simpler way to solve this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return null;
        TreeNode tmp = root.left;
        root.left = invertTree(root.right);
        root.right = invertTree(tmp);
        return root;
    }
}
```
