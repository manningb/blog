This problem revolves around checking if two binary trees are the same. I will first try to implement this using a recursive solution, traversing through both trees at the same rate and comparing their value.

**My Solution**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) return true;
        if (p == null || q == null) return false;
        if (p.val == q.val) {
            return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
        } else {
            return false;
        }

    }
}
```

I was happy with the solution that I ended up with above. Although this problem is very easy, I think my solution above is quite simple and concise.
