This problem asks you to find a given value in a binary search tree when given the route.

I think I will try to implement a recursive solution here - which will search both the left and right children and return null if it is not found.

**My Solution**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (root.val == val) {
            return root;
        }
        if (val < root.val) {
            return searchBST(root.left,val);
        } else {
            return searchBST(root.right,val);
        }
    }
}
```

My main difficulty with this task was that I was originally searching both the left and right children of the tree regardless of what the value of the root node was. This meant that in the case that the right child had the correct sub tree, my code first checked the left node and upon not finding the correct value here, returned null. This ultimately meant that the right children were never being checked.

After looking at the discussion, I remembered that trees follow an order. This meant that the value in the left child would be less than the root node and the value on the right side would be more. After discovering this, getting the final solution was clear. I simply checked if the value of the root node was greater than the inputted value and if so check the left child, otherwise check the right.
